# DailyDash

DailyDash is a Single Page Application utilizing a dashboard  to provide users with information from multiple outside sources. This app was designed to help cenbtralize the information I would seek out across multiple different websites as well as allowing me to track my todos. 

DailyDash makes use of two external APIs to incorporate the following:

* Weather Data - [AccuWeather] (https://developer.accuweather.com/)
* News Data - [NewsAPI] (https://newsapi.org/)

[Frontend Repo] (https://github.com/JTSwisher/capstone_react_frontend) | [Backend Repo] (https://github.com/JTSwisher/capstone_backend_api)
